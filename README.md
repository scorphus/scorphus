### Hi there 👋

I'm [Pablo][website], computer scientist and open-source enthusiast contributor. I live in beautiful
Munich, Germany, working as lead software engineer. In my free time, I maintain various open-source
projects, such as:

- [Oh My Fish][oh-my-fish]: the [Fish Shell][fish-shell] framework. It provides core infrastructure
  that allows installation of plugins and themes
- [Thumbor][thumbor]: a smart imaging service. It enables on-demand crop, resizing and flipping of
  images
- [thumbor-wand-engine][]: an imaging engine for Thumbor built on top of [ImageMagick][wand]
- [The Fuck][thefuck]: a magnificent app that corrects errors in previous console commands (thx for
  helping, [@divykj][divykj]!)
- [Tsuru][tsuru]: an extensible open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that makes application
  deployment quick and easy

I also mentor 🙌 hackathons such as [HackIllinois][mentor-spotlight], the largest OSS hackathon in
the world. And I also ✍ blog from time to time, mostly about coding, on [my website][website] —
there you can find my contact links 📫 and ask me about anything! 💬

Besides that, I'm currently learning 🦀 [Rust][advent-of-code-2018] and 💜 [Elixir][advent-of-code].
And, as I ❤️ love coding quite a lot, I try to always [keep][advent-of-code-2020] my axe
[sharp][pythonchallengesolutions].

Beyond coding, I also love 🚴‍♂️ cycling, 🏔 hiking and ☕️ coffee that can be labeled specialty.
