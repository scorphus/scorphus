### Hi there :wave:

I'm [Pablo][website], computer scientist and open-source enthusiast contributor. I live in beautiful
Munich, Germany, working as lead software engineer. In my free time, I maintain various open-source
projects, such as:

- [Oh My Fish][oh-my-fish]: the [Fish Shell][fish-shell] framework. It provides core infrastructure
  that allows installation of plugins and themes
- [Thumbor][thumbor]: a smart imaging service. It enables on-demand crop, resizing and flipping of
  images
- [thumbor-wand-engine][]: an imaging engine for Thumbor built on top of [ImageMagick][wand]
- [The Fuck][thefuck]: a magnificent app that corrects errors in previous console commands (thx for
  helping, [@divykj][divykj]!)
- [Tsuru][tsuru]: an extensible open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that makes application
  deployment quick and easy

I also mentor :raised_hands: hackathons such as [HackIllinois][mentor-spotlight], the largest OSS
hackathon in the world. And I also :writing_hand: blog from time to time, mostly about coding, on
[my website][website] — there you can find my contact links :mailbox: and ask me about anything!
:speech_balloon:

I am currently learning [:gem::diamonds:Ruby][aoc15] and giving [:zap:Zig][aoc21] a bit of attention.
I try and keep touching base with [<sub>:green_heart:</sub><sup>:blue_heart:</sup>Clojure][aoc17],
[:crab:Rust][aoc18] and [:purple_heart:Elixir][aoc19]. And, as I love coding so much, I try to always
[keep][aoc20] my axe [sharp][pychal].

Beyond coding, I also love [:biking_man: cycling][strava], [:mountain_snow: hiking][strava] and
:coffee: coffee that can be labeled specialty.
